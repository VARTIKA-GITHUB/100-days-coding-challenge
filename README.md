# 100-days-coding-challenge 
Hello there! 
I’m Vartika, and this is my personal repository documenting my 100 Days of Coding Challenge.
Every single day, I’ll be solving a new problem and sharing my solutions here — consistently, passionately, and with a hunger to grow.

This journey isn’t just about writing code… it’s about building discipline, sharpening problem-solving skills, and pushing my limits one day at a time.

Stay tuned to follow my daily progress — let’s turn consistency into mastery!
